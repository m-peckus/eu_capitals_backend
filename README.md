EU Capital Quiz App

![App Demo](app_demo.gif)  

Overview  

The EU Capital Quiz App is a full-stack web application designed to quiz users on EU capitals.  
The app provides information on a city based on user input, including confirmation of whether the city is an EU capital,  
population data, currency exchange rate (if applicable), and weather temperature.  

Project Goals  

This project started as a learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with making multiple API calls and real-world API integration.  
The primary goal was building a web application locally.  
Over time, it evolved into a full-stack app deployed on a cloud server.  
The application tracks quiz progress and provides detailed information about European Union capitals.  

Project Highlights  

Focused on real-world API integration.  
Demonstrates conditional logic based on user input.  
Tracks progress across 27 EU capitals.  
Fully deployed on a live server.  

Features

EU Capital Confirmation: The app verifies if the city is an EU capital and displays relevant information.  
City Population: Displays the population of the city. (API call)  
Country Population: Each capital city is mapped to its corresponding country and country population data is displayed. (API call)  
Currency Exchange Rate: If the local currency is not Euro, the exchange rate to the Euro will be displayed. (API call)  
Weather Information: Displays the current weather in the city. (API call)
